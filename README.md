# Jigsaw-BulletHell
currently on hiatus but i might return one day (maybe) \
the idea is that basically you play a simple jigsaw puzzle with your mouse cursor \
the catch is that you also have to dodge projectiles with your mouse cursor \
puzzle + bullet hell is the default game mode \
but you can also just play the puzzle alone or the bullet hell alone as 2 more game modes \
\
the concept sounds pretty interesting, however it does have some issues \
first of them is the bullet hell itself (how should it be designed so that it leaves room for the puzzle-solving?)\
second of them is a visibility issue (how many projectiles until you can't see the puzzle you're solving?)\
\
i'll likely find a way to address these problems and balance the game once i go back to it, but that's not going to be anytime soon
